    <blockquote>In this song, Selena sings about the negative habits of her former lover (Beiber) that harmed their relationship and led to them parting ways. His unresponsible, reckless activity got her so frustrated she was forced to end their relationship. This song also features Kygo, but it is still in here because it's so good.</blockquote>

    <h4>Lose You To Love Me</h4>
    <br>

    </div>
    
    <blockquote>She wrote this after she broke up with Justin Beiber, so the lyrics could be explaining her feelings about him and after their break up. This song rings so true because of the authenticity and sincerity of Selena who breathes emotion into each line, having lived it.</blockquote>
