Hi, so.. let's jump right in! My project's name is Best Songs Ever and it is aiming to ease finding good pop songs to listen to quickly. There are songs caterogized by their artist and a song ranking to find the best of the best. I feel like nowadays it's hard to find songs with a nice beat, and not what is simply 'trending'. Sometimes we listen to trending songs just because other people like it. But, here I have handpicked my favorite songs and chose which ones are the best for you to enjoy. And, if you happen to be bored, or want to brush up on your music trivia there are a few fun games to play!

*Demo app and all pages*

It did take some time to make all of the pages, especially the artists pages, but it seeing the result made me really satisfied.
There are links hidden everywhere so I got a LOT of practice coding them.

# Part 4
I have used a good amount of HTML and CSS and a little of JavaScript to make this app. The JavaScript is only in the Submit button at in the form and the button to take you to the advertisement video. I made this website entirely on replit, so thanks to whoever made replit.

I could work on adding more content on most of the pages, as some of the pages are quite small, but considering that I made this in a few weeks, I am proud of myself. I could also make it easier to find things, and maybe make my website more pleasing to the eye. Overall, I think there is a lot of space for improvement, but I am proud with how far I've come.
