    <blockquote>A quick beat and soft vocals envelop a wonderful song that talks about a wandering manâ€”that man being Mendes. In this song, the singer is going all-in with this mysterious girl. The pop star proves again that a relationship is empowering, and love is a mysterious thing.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Selena has several EDM collaborations, but "It Ain't Me" takes the cake. Glitchy production and a chorus built for sing-alongs fill this track with personality and light, something most of her other songs don't always have.</blockquote>

    <blockquote>In their latest video, One Direction sets their sights on the stratosphere and takes their fans through a NASA training program. It's a more entertaining exploration than their straightforward clips. Also, the tune is super catchy and fun.</blockquote>

      <h3>4. So Am I</h3>

    </div>
    
    <blockquote>In this song, the lyrics spread a really powerful message. Ava Max sings about the issue of insecurity being felt by victims of segregation. She stands for all these people who are not accepted in any part of life. She reassures them, telling them not to be overly bothered because they are not alone in their feelings and worries.</blockquote>
